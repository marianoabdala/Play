# Play

Playgrounds aren't easy to create. Xcode requires you to pick a name and location before you can actually start to code.

When there's something you *need* to rapidly try and test, it may be frustrating to go through that many steps.

Play will create a new playground in your `/Desktop` conveniently named and will open it right away. All you need to do is type `Play` on your Spotlight Search bar and press Enter.
